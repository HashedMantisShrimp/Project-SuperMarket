# Project-SuperMarket

With the Theme of "Everyday Magic" me and my team decided to make a sort of "quest-based game". Somewhere during the middle of the Jam we
figured out the game could not be finished in 48hrs so we decided to finish the game regardless.

Project SuperMarket is a casual 3D game meant to be played on PCs.

The game takes place in a Covid19-pandemic in which the player finds himself at his family's house. He then takes quests from his
fellow family members to go to the supermarket and purchase whatever was asked of him. 
On the way to and on the SuperMarket there will be quite the number of citizens roaming around, the player's job is to successfully get the
requested groceries while evading the "sick" citizens.
There will be a moodlet-bar somewhere on the UI that will tell the user how happy/healthy the player is with his current condition
If the player lets himself be touched enough times by the infected citizens, the moodlet will drop to the bottom and the idea is to show a
cutscene with the player sick in bed and being taken care of by his family.

The game is still under development and some ideas may or may not change. A brief description of the code will be added once most or all parts of the game have been programmed.
